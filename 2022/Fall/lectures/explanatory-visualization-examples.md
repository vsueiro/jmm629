This is a **counter-example** I used in class: 

[https://infograficos.estadao.com.br/cultura/instituto-moreira-salles/](https://infograficos.estadao.com.br/cultura/instituto-moreira-salles/)

Even though it is a step-by-step content, it is mostly describing something – not explaining it.

To put it in [Nicky’s](https://ncase.me) words, I connected each step with a “and then”, not with a “but” or “therefore”.
